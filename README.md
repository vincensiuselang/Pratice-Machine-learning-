# My Machine Learning Journey with Scikit-Learn

## Introduction
This repository documents my personal journey learning Machine Learning using the scikit-learn library in Python. It contains various exercises, projects, and experiments that I've worked on to develop my understanding of ML concepts and techniques.

## Learning Path

### Basics of Machine Learning
In the `DASAR2 ML SCIKITLEARN` directory, I started with the fundamentals:
- Understanding the scikit-learn API
- Learning about supervised vs. unsupervised learning
- Exploring basic algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbors
- Working with model evaluation metrics

### Hands-on Practice with Various Datasets
The `SEMUA LATIHANN` (All Exercises) directory contains my practice with different datasets:

- **Iris Dataset**: My first classification problem, where I learned to classify iris flowers based on their features
- **Wine Dataset**: Explored classification techniques for wine quality prediction
- **Breast Cancer Dataset**: Worked on a binary classification problem with medical data
- **Diabetes Dataset**: Practiced regression techniques to predict disease progression
- **Titanic Dataset**: Explored feature engineering and classification for survival prediction
- **California Housing**: Tackled a regression problem to predict housing prices

### Advanced Techniques
In the `Tingkat lanjut` (Advanced Level) directory, I explored more sophisticated ML concepts:

- **Advanced Hyperparameter Tuning**: Learning to optimize model parameters systematically
- **Automated Hybrid Models**: Experimenting with Auto-sklearn and TPOT for automated ML
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Understanding probabilistic approaches to hyperparameter tuning
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Working with PCA, t-SNE, and other techniques
- **Feature Selection**: Learning to identify the most important features for models
- **Feature Transformation**: Exploring different ways to transform and scale features
- **Model Interpretation**: Understanding how to interpret complex ML models
- **Neural Networks**: Experimenting with MLPClassifier and MLPRegressor from scikit-learn
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combining multiple models for better performance

### From Data to Deployment
The `load dataset sampai deploy` directory documents my journey from loading datasets to deploying models:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Model training and evaluation
- Saving and loading models
- Creating simple APIs for model deployment

## Future Learning Goals
- Explore more advanced ensemble techniques
- Dive deeper into neural networks with TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Learn more about model explainability
- Work on time series forecasting problems
- Develop skills in MLOps and model monitoring

## Conclusion
This repository serves as both documentation of my learning journey and a reference for future projects. Each directory contains specific examples and code that demonstrate different aspects of machine learning with scikit-learn.
